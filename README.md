# Progetto Eco

Progetto Eco is a blog website made in mainly PHP, using the MVC pattern, on eco sustainability that I created in high school.

## Installation

Just install the .zip file of the entire folder. If it's your first time developing in PHP, then install XAMPP following [this guide](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-get-started-with-php/#what-is-xampp).

## Contributing

For major changes, please open an issue first
to discuss what you would like to change. Or if you want, you can send me a message on [X](https://x.com/giova2217) about improvements to add or something else that you want to ask.

Every tip you give is more helpful than you think as I want to improve to get better at programming.
